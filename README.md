# kmeans-microcontroller

## Description
This is the k-Means implementation for microcontrollrs based on the literature "Ultra-low Power Embedded Unsupervised
Learning Smart Sensor for Industrial Fault Classification" - Paper by Geis et al. 

Note: The optimized version of this algorithm is not available to the public.

## Usage

The setup just demostrates the pipeline where the size of variables defined in the algorithm module with the k-Means train and prediction functions must be changed based on the usage.
